This is a companion to my dissertation thesis. 
It contains: 
 - full lists of Siamese color graphs (SCGs) in binary and base-24 representation divided into three parts by the isomorphism classes of graphs contained within.
 - functions in both Python and GAP to compute adjacency matrices and permutation voltages representations from the representation given here
 - list of all graphs and tables of interest used during our computations.
    
In the case of mixed SCGs, graphs represented by the first two numbers of the 4-tuple binary representations are non-geometric while graphs represent by the latter two are geometric.
